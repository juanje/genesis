Application life-cycle manager, codename Genesis, is part of the Moblin application framework, exposing interface for application developers to conveniently access application information, starting an application by calling a single API, and processing various run-time statuses for each running application.

It also maintains the application list for the applications that are installed in the system, and updates the list whenever a change happens in the monitored applications.

The purpose of the application life cycle management project, codename Genesis, is two fold:

1. Provide a set of utility functions for applications on the platform to quickly and easily walk through the desktop files on a standard Linux system to expose applications and their categories. 

2. Provide a mechanism for launching applications and tracking the execution of those applications to watch for resource starvation, hangs, unresponsiveness, etc.
