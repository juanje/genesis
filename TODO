Todo List:

* Back-end daemon initializing controller instance, and supporting automatic application list update when any application is installed / removed / updated.

* Application crash and hang-up detection, system resource starving detection / quota enforcement.

* Optimization on application entry metadata structure, reducing memory footprint.

* Gracefully acquiring and managing metadata from non-freedesktop aligned applications.
